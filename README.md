# SaneGenesis Evolution

SaneGenesis Evolution is an AI-driven emergent society simulation where autonomous agents evolve, interact, and form civilizations. This CLI-based simulation leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, reinforcement learning, and persistent memory to create a living world where entities adapt, strategize, and make independent decisions.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **AI-Driven Decision Making** – Agents use CoT reasoning to strategize, negotiate, and evolve.
- **Persistent World State** – The simulation saves all agent interactions and world changes, allowing it to resume from the last session.
- **Eye-Catching CLI Interface** – Dynamic and visually engaging CLI displays real-time agent decisions and world events.
- **Emergent Societies & Cultures** – AI entities form governments, alliances, and engage in diplomacy, trade, or warfare.
- **Autonomous Evolution** – Agents learn and adapt based on past interactions and environmental factors.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Simulation
```sh
python main.py
```

### 3️⃣ Saving & Resuming
- The simulation **automatically saves** the world state and agent memories.
- Restarting the simulation will **resume from the last saved state.**

## ⚙️ Configuration
Modify `config.py` to tweak simulation parameters, AI behavior settings, and logging options.

## 💡 Future Enhancements:

- Advanced AI evolution with deeper learning mechanisms.
- Extended agent interactions with deception, alliances, and betrayal.
- More detailed economy and warfare mechanics.
